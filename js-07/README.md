## Description

The TypeScript code defines a `peopleObject` type, which represents a person's attributes like `id`, `name`, `age`, and others. The code also includes functions for creating, updating, and removing person objects, as well as a function for sorting an array of person objects based on a specified property.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the code to your project.
2. Customize the `peopleObject` type according to your needs.

## Functions

### `createPerson(person: peopleObject): void`

This function adds a new person object to the `personList` array.

### `updatePerson(person: peopleObject): void`

This function updates the attributes of an existing person object in the `personList` array based on the provided `id`.

### `removePerson(person: peopleObject): void`

This function removes a person object from the `personList` array based on the provided `id`.

### `sortArrayOfObjects(array: peopleObject[], property: keyof peopleObject, ascending: boolean = true): peopleObject[]`

This function sorts an array of person objects based on the specified property. It returns a new sorted array without modifying the original array.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Initialize personList array
const personList: peopleObject[] = [
    // ... initial person objects ...
];

// Create a new person
createPerson({
    id: "002-aaa",
    name: "jalal",
    lastName: "sins",
    age: 44,
    // ... other attributes ...
});

// Update a person's attribute
updatePerson({
    id: "002-aaa",
    lastName: "sina",
});

// Remove a person
removePerson({
    id: "000-aaa",
});

// Sort the personList array by name
const sortedArray = sortArrayOfObjects(personList, 'name');
console.log(sortedArray);

// Output the updated personList array
console.log(personList);
```

Please make sure to replace the sample data and attributes with your actual data.

## BreakDown
Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
---
1. Defining the Person Type
A peopleObject type is defined, representing attributes that can describe a person. These attributes include id, name, lastName, age, job, maritalStatus, gender, weight, height, and phone.

2. Initializing the List of People
A personList array is initialized with two initial peopleObject instances. These instances represent different people with various attributes.

3. Creating a Person
The createPerson function allows adding a new person to the personList array. It takes a person object as a parameter and pushes it to the array.

4. Updating a Person
The updatePerson function allows updating the attributes of an existing person in the personList array. It finds the index of the person using their id and merges the updated attributes into the existing person.

5. Removing a Person
The removePerson function enables removing a person from the personList array. It finds the index of the person using their id and removes them from the array using the splice method.

6. Sorting People
The sortArrayOfObjects function provides a way to sort an array of peopleObject instances based on a specified attribute. It takes the array, the property to sort by, and an optional parameter for sorting in ascending or descending order. It returns a new sorted array.

7. Sorting and Output
A sortedArray is generated by sorting the personList array based on the name attribute. The sorted array is then logged to the console.

8. Demonstrating Operations
Several operations are demonstrated using the defined functions:

A new person named "jalal" is created and added to the list.
The last name of the person with ID "002-aaa" is updated to "sina".
The person with ID "000-aaa" is removed from the list.
9. Displaying Updated List
The updated personList array is logged to the console to showcase the effects of the demonstrated operations.
