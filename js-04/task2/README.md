# Function to convert Celsius_Fahrenheit
This JavaScript code defines a function `Celsius_Fahrenheit` that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. It also includes a simple user interaction through the `prompt` function to input the Celsius temperature.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The function `Celsius_Fahrenheit` is defined, which takes a single parameter `cel`, representing the temperature in Celsius.

2. Inside the function, a variable `far` is declared to store the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.

3. The conversion formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit is applied: `Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.

4. The converted Fahrenheit temperature is returned as the result of the function.

5. After defining the function, the code then uses `prompt` to display a dialog box to the user asking them to enter the Celsius temperature. The `+` sign before `prompt` is used to convert the user's input (which is initially a string) to a number.

6. The entered Celsius temperature is stored in the variable `cel`.

7. The code then calls the `Celsius_Fahrenheit` function, passing the `cel` variable as an argument, to convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.

8. The converted temperature value is then printed to the console using `console.log`.

Let's say you run the code, and in the prompt, you enter the value `20` as the Celsius temperature. The code will calculate the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature using the `Celsius_Fahrenheit` function and then log the result to the console.

For example, if you enter `20`, the output will be:

```
The value of the temperature in Fahrenheit is 68
```

This indicates that 20 degrees Celsius is equivalent to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The code successfully converted the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and provided the result through the console log.
