# Random Data Generator in JavaScript
This JavaScript code generates a list of objects with random dates, random numbers, and random names and then logs the list to the console.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The `randomDate` function generates a random date between two specified dates. It takes two optional parameters: `from` (the starting date, defaulting to March 2, 2020) and `to` (the ending date, defaulting to the current date).

2. The `randomName` function returns a random name from the `nameList` array. It selects a random index within the range of the array length and returns the corresponding name.

3. The variable `myList` is initialized as an empty array, where we'll store the generated objects.

4. The `addToList` function creates an object `myObject` with three properties:
   - `myDate`: A random date generated by calling the `randomDate` function.
   - `myNumber`: A random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `myName`: A random name generated by calling the `randomName` function.

5. After creating the `myObject`, it is added to the `myList` array using the `push` method.

6. The `addToList` function is called once, which generates one random object and adds it to the `myList`.

7. Finally, the `myList` array is logged to the console using `console.log`, displaying the generated object(s).

The code can be utilized to generate random data for testing or other purposes. If you call the `addToList` function multiple times, it will add more random objects to the `myList` array.
